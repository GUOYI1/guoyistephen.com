<p>I am currently a master student in the Computer and Information Science Department of University of Pennsylvania., major in Computer Graphics and Game Technology(CGGT).</p>
<p>I am a big fan of computer and information science, especially the computer graphics and computer Vision. This is the space where I share my portfolio. I hope you can learn more about me from here.</p>

      <p><br>
        This is an online tool to help users to produce the dual structure of a 2D polygon. Except for the external edges(the green ones), all the edges (the blue ones) in the dual structure are connected to each other to form a close polygon and each edge is perpendicular to a corresponding edge in the original graph.I developed this tool for the Polyhedral Structures Lab of PennDesign. Visit PSL websit for more about the related reasearch.</p>

      <p>This project helps users to remove the vignette of the image.The code is implemented according to paper of &quot;<em>Single-Image Vignetting Correction</em>&quot;,by <em>Yuanjie Zheng,Stephen Lin</em>,etc.Both c++ and Matlab source codes are provided. For the Matlab version, I revise some parts of the code offered by the author, Yuanjie Zheng. For the C++ version, it is implemented by  Donghai Xie(my supervisor) and me. </p></td>

      <p><strong><br>
      </strong>This project efficiently reconstructs  the 3D stereo scene from a group of 2D images. We use the GPU parallel calculation for the Graphics Processing. The whole reconstruction process includes camera calibration,  feature detection with SIFT algorithm, feature matching, triangulation and  feature points densification.</p>
